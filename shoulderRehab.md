## Patient Case Summary
**Problem**: Dead hangs caused shoulder pain due to poor **external rotation stability** (rotator cuff weakness).  
**Solution**: 3 targeted exercises → **immediate pain-free dead hangs**. 【32.32, type: source】

## Exercise Protocol (Perform in Sequence)

### 1. Seated External Rotations
Target: Rotator cuff stability Equipment: Light dumbbell/cable Reps: 3 sets of 12-15

**[Video Demo (0:09)](https://youtu.be/SohFceqQ4u7wHh9?t=9)** 【9.599, type: source】 

### 2. Banded W with Raise
Key Feature: Hold top position 5 seconds Equipment: Resistance band Reps: 3 sets of 10 (5-sec holds)

**[Video Demo (0:20)](https://youtu.be/SohFceqQ4u7wHh9?t=20)** 【9.599, type: source】 

### 3. 90° External Rotation (Advanced)
Execution:

Rotate to 90° → PAUSE 3 seconds
Continue overhead → PAUSE 3 seconds
Controlled return Equipment: Band/cable Reps: 3 sets of 8-10

## Expected Results
> "We then immediately retested, and this time he could do his dead hangs **without any shoulder pain at all."** 【32.32, type: source】 

**Mechanism**: Strengthened rotator cuff prevents humeral head migration during overhead loading. 【32.32, type: source】

## Progressions
| Week | Sets × Reps | Hold Time | Resistance |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 1-2  | 3×12-15     | 3 sec     | Light      |
| 3-4  | 3×10-12     | 5 sec     | Medium     |
| 5+   | 4×8-10      | 5-8 sec   | Heavy      |
